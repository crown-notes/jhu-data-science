# Version Control

Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions, collaborate effectively, and keep records of who made which changes and why.

Version control systems like Git are more sophisticated than simple track changes features, since they can meticulously track changes on many files with multiple people working simultaneously. Without version control, users may keep multiple similar copies of files, which can lead to errors and confusion.

The benefits of version control include keeping a single updated version of each file with a record of all previous versions and a record of exactly what changed between versions.

It helps when collaborating with others by tracking who, when, and why specific changes were made. It also helps when developing code, since if a mistake is introduced, the user can revert to the original, unbroken code. Additionally, it allows multiple people to work on the same file and merge all edits into one cohesive file.

## Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is a free and open-source version control system that is the most commonly used today. Git keeps a local copy of your work and revisions that you can use offline. Once the user has internet access, they can sync their local copy with the main online repository.

Git also allows multiple collaborators to work on their own parts of the code simultaneously. RStudio and Git interface easily with each other. GitHub is an online interface for Git, acting as a host for files and records of changes. It is similar to Dropbox in that files are both on the user's computer and hosted online.

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub allows users to keep repositories private or public, and it interfaces with Git to keep track of file versions and changes.

## Key Terminology

- **Repository (repo):** This is equivalent to a project folder where all version-controlled files and their changes are stored.
- **Commit:** This is a snapshot of the files at a specific time. Git compares the current version of files with the previous versions, loads changes, and uploads new versions. Typically, a commit is accompanied by a note explaining the changes.
- **Push:** This is the action of updating the online repository with the user's committed changes so that everyone has access to those edits.
- **Pull:** This updates a local version of the repository to the current online version, since others may have made changes.
- **Staging:** This is the act of preparing a file for a commit, allowing users to separate changes into separate commits.
- **Branch:** This is when a file has two simultaneous copies, one on the user's local machine and one on the online repository.
- **Merging:** This is the process of incorporating independent edits of the same file into a single unified file.
- **Conflict:** This occurs when multiple people make changes to the same file, and Git is unable to automatically merge the edits.
- **Clone:** This is making a copy of an existing Git repository.
- **Fork:** This is a personal copy of a repository taken from another user.
